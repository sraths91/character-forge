# Deferred work

Animation / cinema items that were consciously cut from a milestone,
with enough context to pick them back up. Recreated during M56 — the
original file was referenced from CLAUDE.md but never committed.

## From M44.5 — directional facing (east/west profiles)

Both cinema actors render south-facing (toward the camera). The
sprite cache is already keyed `${id}|${direction}`
(cinema-sprites.js) and `makeLpcDrawSprite` derives a direction per
actor, but `directionForActor` always returns `'south'`: the M51
Phase 2 decision was that the real LPC attack art (body
slash/thrust/cast + weapon slash sheets) is authored south, and
east/west profile rows would need their own weapon-overlay rigs.
Picking this up means: per-direction swing rigs in weapon-swing.js,
east/west pre-renders in the existing cache, and flipping
`directionForActor` to attacker→east / defender→west.

## From M56 — spell-cast cinema (Phase 2)

- **Counterspell / Shield "fizzle" cinema.** A counterspelled cast
  and a Shield-negated Magic Missile or spell attack dispatch no
  cinema at all (`runMonsterSpell` returns before resolution). A
  short fizzle sequence — glyph that sputters out, no projectile —
  would close the loop. The engine return points are marked in
  combat-engine.js.
- **AoE group-shot framing.** Fireball frames only the hardest-hit
  target in the 1v1 cinema; the other victims stay log-only. The
  engine already collects per-target results (`aoeResults` in the
  AoE branch) — a group-shot variant would need a multi-defender
  cinema layout, which is a real layout/renderer change.
- **Non-registry spell fallback has no cinema.** Spells without a
  `monster-spells.js` entry (homebrew) resolve through the legacy
  `runAttackPrompt` / `runSpellSavePrompt` path outside the engine
  and never reach `onCinemaRound`. The single-spine fix is to fold
  that fallback into the engine rather than adding a second dispatch
  site.

## From M56 — opportunity attacks (Phase 4)

- **Shield-negated OA renders as a miss cinema.** `runReactionAttack`
  folds a Shield save into the generic `!atk.hit` return with no
  `shielded` flag, so the OA cinema plays a miss — inconsistent with
  the cast path's no-dispatch-on-Shield rule. Fix alongside the
  fizzle cinema above (flag `atk.shielded` like the main path does).

## Older deferrals still open

- **Multi-attack combo sequencing.** Extra Attack / Flurry of Blows
  resolve as separate cinema rounds with full wind-ups. A
  `compositeSequence` that chains them (second wind-up overlapping
  the first recovery, one shared verdict header) would read as a
  combo. Needs the engine to batch multi-attacks before dispatching.
- **Cinema contact shadows.** `idlePoseAt` returns
  `shadowScale`/`shadowAlpha` (used on the character page); the
  cinema's idle breathing (M56 Phase 6) consumes only bob/sway/lean
  because the cinema draws no contact shadow to pulse.
